# Problem

Please write a PHP class Deck which represents a deck of cards. The Deck class should off 2 public methods: shuffle() and deal(int hands).

* shuffle()
  * This method should shuffle and return a list of the cards in the shuffled order.

* deal(int hands)
  * This method should deal out the number of hands specified by the input variable 'hands' and return the hands as a list.
  * The input value for "hands" should be restricted to 2 to 5 inclusively.
  * Each hand should consist of 5 cards.
